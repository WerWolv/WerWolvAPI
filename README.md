# WerWolvAPI

Public repository for my main API endpoint found at https://api.werwolv.net

## Available APIs

- ImHex: In-App "store", tips, repository pulling and updating, etc.
- Misc: Miscelaneous stuff that doesn't fit anywhere really or is too small and insignificant for its own API

## Running

- install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- copy config_template.py to config.py (and modify values accordingly)
- run using `python -m wsgi`
